# ModifiedChannels
You will need to remove aard_channels_fiendish.xml and aard_chat_echo.xml plugins and install these instead. Keep the 'modified' in the name so you don't overwrite the current plugins.

# Commands
mute [player] - Will mute a player, preventing seeing them on channels. Without an argument, displays who you have muted.
mute clear - Clears your mute list.
