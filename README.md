# ModifiedChannels
You will need to remove aard_channels_fiendish.xml and aard_chat_echo.xml plugins and install these instead. Keep the 'modified' in the name so you don't overwrite the current plugins. Please note this is only confirmed to be working in the latest snapshot of the package. It is possible that this may not work in earlier versions due to any changes Fiendish might have made between your version and the latest. Please consider upgrading. It's painless, and recommended!

# Commands
mute [player] - Will mute a player, preventing seeing them on channels. Without an argument, displays who you have muted.
mute clear - Clears your mute list.
